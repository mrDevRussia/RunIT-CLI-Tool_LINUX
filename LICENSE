Disclaimer for p2pmsg feature

The p2pmsg module in RunIT allows users to exchange messages via local or networked sessions using a 16-digit session code. Security measures have been implemented to encrypt and protect messages, but users must acknowledge the following:

1. Local Environment Only: p2pmsg is primarily designed for same-machine or trusted local network usage. Sharing the session code outside trusted environments may expose messages.

2. No Liability for Misuse: The author is not responsible for data loss, exposure, or misuse arising from improper configuration, shared access, or attempts to bypass session restrictions.

3. Experimental Feature: Some security enhancements, such as authenticated encryption and replay protection, are provided, but they do not guarantee absolute security against determined attackers.

4. Resource Limitations: High memory usage may occur on low-RAM systems during encryption operations. Users should ensure sufficient system resources before starting sessions.

5. Compliance: Users are responsible for ensuring that usage of p2pmsg complies with local laws regarding encrypted communications.



By using p2pmsg, you acknowledge and accept these terms.
